                    <p>Prior to becoming a <span class="deep-purple-text lighten-1">full-stack developer</span>, I worked as a chemist in a manufacturing company. Some days after work, I wanted to take a breather from chemistry. My friends and family suggested to try some programming since I grew up around computers, and it was always something I was working with. After taking some free online courses, I realized how much I enjoyed programming and problem solving. I decided to make the transition into web development.</p>
                    <p>I recently graduated from the Coding Dojo bootcamp in San Jose, where I had the opportunity to work with veterans and newcomers. Coding with both groups helped improve my own work because I was able to ask questions about parts where I had trouble with and help others in need.</p>
